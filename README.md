Senior design project, Spring 2015.

If you create an new app using 'python manage.py startapp', always the add the migrations folder to the .gitignore, add and commit ONLY the .gitignore (but do not push), then add and commit the remaining files.

This rule applies to all files that should be ignored, ignore them first!
